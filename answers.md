**Q1 – Leveraging AI in Front-End Delivery**

In a fast-paced startup, AI-powered tools can significantly speed up front-end development while maintaining high code quality. For example, GitHub Copilot can assist in writing React components faster by auto-suggesting functional structures, CSS, and even complex hooks based on short comments. A developer might type `// responsive navbar` and get a usable draft in seconds, cutting down boilerplate time.

Design assistants like Figma’s AI features or Uizard can auto-generate design mockups or convert hand-drawn wireframes into HTML/CSS, allowing designers and developers to iterate quickly. During a product sprint, an AI design assistant could generate a mobile-first layout directly from product specs, allowing for faster validation with stakeholders.

Additionally, tools like DeepCode or SonarLint can be integrated into the CI pipeline to detect bugs, accessibility issues, or inconsistent styling early—ensuring that speed doesn’t compromise maintainability or performance.

**Q2 – Inventing an AI Feature for Class 11 Students**

**Feature 1: Concept Visualizer** – Uses AI to generate interactive simulations for Physics topics like projectile motion or electromagnetism. Students input formulas or problem text, and the AI auto-generates animations with step-by-step visual explanations.

**Feature 2: Smart Problem Explainer** – Students upload textbook questions or take a photo. AI parses it and provides guided solutions, highlighting key concepts used (e.g., Newton’s Laws, Free Body Diagrams), with adaptive hints if a student gets stuck.

**User Journey (Plain Text)**:

1. Student logs into the app and selects “Revision Mode.”
2. They upload or select a chapter (e.g., Laws of Motion).
3. For a tricky question, they snap a photo or type it in.
4. AI explains each step interactively—concepts, formulas, and logic flow.
5. For abstract topics, they switch to “Concept Visualizer” to see it in motion.
6. After practice, a short AI-generated quiz helps them reinforce the topic.
